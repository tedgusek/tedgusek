### Welcome to Ted's Github page!

I'm so glad you came to visit.  Feel free to look around and if you have any questions, please reach out.
I've always loved to take things aart and see how they work, and put them back together.  This is something that has been with me forever.  If I'm able to create something that brings joy or ease to someone's life, that's even better!

Most recently working on **LambdaWG**, I played a pivotal role in building out the open-source **AWS Lambda** monitoring platform.  Rendering interactive charts and graphs with the ingested data from the serverless functions.

As a former photographer and designer, I bring a unique package to the table, being able to create code with a very user-centric mindset.  And having run my own business here in NYC, I am able to handle managing cross-functional teams in fast-paced environement and know how to pivot as needed in an ever changing environment.

When my face isn't stuck in the monitor, neck deep in code, I'm out with the kids.  Either riding bikes in the park, gardening in our communal plot, or swinging from the monkey bars.  Spawned from necessity, my love for cooking continues to grow.  I'm always looking for new recipes, or modifying old ones.  I feel really lucky to be where I am these days, and look forward to continuing to learn new things.

## Here's a look at what I've been working on:
- [LambdaWG]([https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Lambdawg])
  - Open source GUI for AWS Lambda Monitoring.
- [ComingSoon]([https://github.com/tedgusek/portfolio_site])
  - Personal portfolio site strictly to showcase my engineering skills, built with the excuse to play with some tools I haven't used in a bit.
- [tedgusek](https://www.tedgusek.com/)
  - Just for fun, take a look at some of my photos I've taken over the years.
