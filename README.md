### Welcome to Ted's Github page!

I'm so glad you came to visit.  Feel free to look around and if you have any questions, please reach out.
I've always loved to take things apart, see how they work, and put them back together.  This is something that's been with me forever.  If I'm able to create something that brings joy or ease to someone's life, that's even better!

Most recently working on **LambdaWG**, I played a pivotal role in building out the open-source **AWS Lambda** monitoring platform.  Rendering interactive charts and graphs with the ingested data from the serverless functions.

As a former photographer and designer, I bring a unique package to the table, being able to create code with a very user-centric mindset.  And having run my own business here in NYC, I am able to handle managing cross-functional teams in a fast-paced world and know how to pivot as needed in an ever changing environment.

When my face isn't stuck in the monitor, neck deep in code, I'm out with the kids.  Either riding bikes in the park, gardening in our communal plot, or swinging from the monkey bars.  Spawned from necessity, my love for cooking continues to grow.  I'm always looking for new recipes, or modifying old ones.  I feel really lucky to be where I am these days, and look forward to continuing to learn new things.

## Here's a look at what I've been working on:
- [Marvel Fights](https://github.com/tedgusek/marvelFights)
  - Utilizing Marvel's DB API and OpenAI's Text and Image generators, I created a Comic generator!  Follow the documentation to set it up on your own machine, or reach out for a demo!
- [Carlton Bears Garden](https://www.carltonbearsgarden.com/)
  - I recently deployed a mobile first site for a local community garden to streamline the their membership services.  Some strecth goals are to build out a photo gallery, and connect it to Google Calendar to make it easier to sign up for shifts, and share community events with other members.
